										<h1>My First Teaching Experience: <br> Bocconi Summer School 2023</h1>

									<p>From learning about new topics, to sharing knowledge, the exchange of ideas defines the interaction between the student and the teacher. For as long as I can remember, my involvement in this process happened from the perspective of the student. This changed, however, with the Bocconi Summer School for High School Students. This event brought together talented and ambitious students that wish to see how going to Uni feels like. </p>
									<p>Together with PhD student Francesco Mascari, I was an instructor in the Data Science lab. Our goal was to explain the most common steps of a data science project, and guide the students to conduct a similar analysis on their own. Starting from the basics of Python coding, to introductory linear algebra, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we provided our students with a crash course on Unsupervised Learning and its uses for dimnesionality reduction, data compression, and visualization. </p>
									<p>It might seem like an overwhelming amount for knowledge to jump in from a high school background, but the students definitley showed that they were up to the task. Through being critical and inquisitive, asking questions, and solving exercises, the class demonstrated the key traits of being a great Data Scientist: curiosity and problem-solving skills. Their efforts were rewarded by the cool findings and results obtained in out applications, from exploring drivers of happiness in different countries, to observing clusters of breast tumors. Have a look at some of the insights we discussed during our session!</p>

									<h2>World Happiness Report</h2>
									<p><a href = https://worldhappiness.report>The World Happiness Report</a> is a publication, released yearly since 2012, containing data about several countries and territories. Each country has a measured <i>Happiness Score</i>, as well as several indicators such as <i>Social Support</i>, <i>Healthy Life Expectancy</i>, <i>Freedom to make your own life choices</i>, <i>Generosity</i>, and <i>Corruption</i>. We would like observe the strenght of the correlation of these features with the overall levels of happiness, as well as understand if geographical location plays a role in this matter. Our analysis is strongly inspired by <a href = https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-022-00184-w>this primer on PCA</a>. The full notebook is available <a href = https://github.com/MateiCosa/Bocconi-Summer-School>in this repository</a>.</p>
									<p>In order to create an inforamtive 2-dimensional visualization of our data, we ran PCA to reduce the number of features from 5 to 2. We then retrieved the coefficients of the vectors representing the directions of our original features. Finally, we plotted the results, focusing on geographical location and happiness levels.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="/images/biplot.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The directions indicated by our 5 initial features are quite interesting. We can observe that <i>Social</i> and <i>Life</i> are very close to each other, indicating a strong positive correlation. <i>Choices</i> and <i>Corruption</i> are almost perfectly opposite to one another, indicating the idea that higher levels of corruption are associated with more limited opportunities and less freedom. Moreover, it is clear that higher levels of happiness are associated with greater levels of  <i>Choices</i>, <i>Social</i> and <i>Life</i>.</p>
						
									<span class="image main"><img src="/images/biplot_2.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The geographic region in which each country resides also adds some interesting information. Unsurprisingly, countries in Western Europe, as well as the US, and Singapore seem to be happier, while states in Sub-Saharan Africa are on the opposite side of the spectrum. One may also notice the extreme outlier on the right part of the plot (Afghanistan), which, unofurtantely scores very poorly across all indicators. Interstingly, there are many similarities between countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Commonwealth states. Another important comment is that we left out the GDP of countries for simplicity, but it is obvious that that it plays a significant role. Furthermore, a natural word of warning must be stressed about drawing conclusions regarding causal relationships, as it is wrong to claim that a higher GDP makes people happier or that corruption limits freedom, solely based on our analysis.</p>

									<h2>Final thoughts on the experience</h2>
									<span class="image right"><img src="/images/summ_4.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Teaching is such a rewarding experience because it allows you help others discover interesting ideas and challenge their abilites. It also forces you to rethink the way you looked at certain concepts, incentivizing you to delve deeper and gain a more profound understanding of familiar topics. This means that not only do you share your knowledge with other people, but you also improve your own grasp of the methods and tools you present.</p>
									<p>Finally, such experiences offer me the chance to explore the prospect of an academic career. Even though it is difficult to predict where my future will take me, exploring different career paths and taking advatage of great opportunities is something that I am very grateful for. It was definitley worth it giving up some time at the beach for this cool event! :)</p>
									<p>I hope to be back next year!</p>
